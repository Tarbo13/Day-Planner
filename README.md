# Project Discription

Here I was tasked with creating a day planner app that would display and track the current time and day.  My app consists of nine hour blocks of time that will be shadded a diffrent color based on the time of day: (Grey == Past, Red == Present, & Green == Future).  A user is able to enter their daily tasks into each hour block and save the entries so that they remain on the page after it is refreshed or closed and reopened.  
I used a combination of Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, and CSS to create this app.  Bootstrap's grid system is used to create the layout of the app.  I then used varous CSS classes to style the page.  I also used FontAwesome in this project to get the disk icons that were used on the save buttons.
